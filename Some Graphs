```{r}
# Create a separate plot for each crime category
crime_trend_plot <- ggplot(cd, aes(x = YEAR, fill = crime_cat)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Crime Trends Over the Years",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  facet_grid(. ~ crime_cat)  

# Print the plot
print(crime_trend_plot)
```

```{r}
# Create a line plot of crime trends over time
cd <- cd %>%
  mutate(Time = as.POSIXct(sub(".* ", "", REPDATETIME), format = "%H:%M"))

crime_time_plot <- ggplot(cd, aes(x = Time, y = ..count.., color = crime_cat)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1800) +

```{r}
# Create a bar plot to show types of crimes committed by juvenile offenders
juvenile_data <- cd[cd$JUV_OFFENDER == "yes", ]


juvenile_crime_plot <- ggplot(juvenile_data, aes(x = crime_cat)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Types of Crimes Committed by Juvenile Offenders",
       x = "Crime Category",

  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  

print(juvenile_crime_plot)
```
This code is giving me a single box under NA rather than seperating them by crime?? 

```{r}
# Create a line plot to show the trend of juvenile crimes throughout the years
juvenile_data <- cd[cd$JUV_OFFENDER == "yes", ]

juvenile_crime_trend_plot <- ggplot(juvenile_data, aes(x = YEAR)) +
  geom_line(stat = "count") +
  labs(title = "Trend of Juvenile Crimes Throughout the Years",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

print(juvenile_crime_trend_plot)

```
This one has the same issue. I need to figure out how to relate the yes to the count

```{r}
# Group the data by year, street, and crime category and count the occurrences
crime_counts <- cd %>%
  group_by(YEAR, LOCATION, crime_cat) %>%
  summarize(Count = n())

# Filter for significant streets or any other relevant condition
significant_streets <- crime_counts %>%
  group_by(LOCATION) %>%
  summarize(correlation = cor(YEAR, Count)) %>%
  filter(abs(correlation) == max(abs(correlation)))

plot_data <- crime_counts %>%
  filter(LOCATION %in% significant_streets$LOCATION)

ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = YEAR, y = Count, color = LOCATION)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "orange") +
  geom_text(aes(label = LOCATION), color = "black", size = 2, hjust = 1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Crime Trends in Different Streets Over the Years",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Crimes",
  )

```
```{r}
# Group the data by year, street, and crime category and count the occurrences
crime_counts <- cd %>%
  group_by(YEAR, LOCATION, crime_cat) %>%
  summarize(Count = n())

min_occurrences_threshold <- 100

significant_streets <- crime_counts %>%
  group_by(LOCATION) %>%
  summarize(Count = sum(Count)) %>%
  filter(Count >= min_occurrences_threshold)

plot_data <- crime_counts %>%
  filter(LOCATION %in% significant_streets$LOCATION)

ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = YEAR, y = Count, color = LOCATION)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "orange") +
  geom_text(aes(label = LOCATION), color = "black", size = 2, hjust = 1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Crime Trends in Different Streets Over the Years",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Crimes",
  )

```
The graphics for this looks terrible, find out how to edit it.
